Beacon is an Android and iOS app that makes it easy to both record and alert preset contacts when that the user is in an encounter with Law Enforcement, with as little phone interaction as possible. Beacon is intended to be used with marginalized youth that have frequent encounters with a variety of different types of Law Enforcement, to ensure they have their own recording of the encounter should they need it later for legal or other purposes. The ability to alert contacts also ensures that the user can feel secure that should Law Enforcement officials detain or otherwise impede their free movement or ability to communicate, there are people on their side that will look out for them.
